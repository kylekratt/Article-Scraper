# Article-Scraper

This application allows you to scrape articles from tech-crunch.com, save which ones you want, delete ones you've saved, and add or delete notes to saved articles. You can view scraped articles by clicking on the navbar title, scrape new ones by clicking on the scrape button, and display saved ones by clicking the view saved button. After scraping, a modal will appear with the option to redirect to the scraped articles.
