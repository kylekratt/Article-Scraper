# Article-Scraper

This application allows you to scrape articles from tech-crunch.com, save which ones you want, delete ones you've saved, and add or delete notes. You can view scraped articles by clicking on the navbar title - the scrape new titles button doesn't have a visual change, but it does update the database. Therefore, you should first click the scrape button and then the title. Saved articles can be viewed and modified by pressing the saved articles button.
